        link to the original message.

            caption_entities (List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.MessageEntity`):

            disable_notification (``bool``, *optional*):
                Sends the message silently.
                Users will receive a notification with no sound.

                Date when the message will be automatically sent.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message`: On success, the copied message is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Copy a message
                await app.copy_message(to_chat, from_chat, 123)
