        """Set a new profile photo or video (H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video, max 5 seconds).

        The ``photo`` and ``video`` arguments are mutually exclusive.
        Pass either one as named argument (see examples below).

        .. note::

            This method only works for Users.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users-bots.rst

        Parameters:
            photo (``str`` | ``BinaryIO``, *optional*):
                Profile photo to set.
                Pass a file path as string to upload a new photo that exists on your local machine or
                pass a binary file-like object with its attribute ".name" set for in-memory uploads.

            video (``str`` | ``BinaryIO``, *optional*):
                Profile video to set.
                Pass a file path as string to upload a new video that exists on your local machine or
                pass a binary file-like object with its attribute ".name" set for in-memory uploads.

            public (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True to upload a public profile photo for users who are restricted from viewing your real profile photos due to your privacy settings.
                Defaults to False.

            for_my_bot (``int`` | ``str``, *optional*):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the bot for which profile photo has to be updated instead of the current user.
                The bot should have ``can_be_edited`` property set to True.

            photo_frame_start_timestamp (``float``, *optional*):
                Floating point UNIX timestamp in seconds, indicating the frame of the video/sticker that should be used as static preview; can only be used if ``video`` or ``video_emoji_markup`` is set.

        Returns:
            ``bool``: True on success.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Set a new profile photo

                await app.set_profile_photo(video="new_video.mp4")
