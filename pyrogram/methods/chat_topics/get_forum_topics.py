        Returns found forum topics in a forum chat.
        This is a temporary method for getting information about topic list from the server

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            query (``str``, *optional*):
                Query to search for in the forum topic's name

            offset_date (:py:obj:`~datetime.datetime`, *optional*):
                The date starting from which the results need to be fetched. Use 0 or any date in the future to get results from the last topic

            offset_message_id (``int``, *optional*):
                The message identifier of the last message in the last found topic, or 0 for the first request

            offset_message_thread_id (``int``, *optional*):
                The message thread identifier of the last found topic, or 0 for the first request

            limit (``int``, *optional*):
                The maximum number of forum topics to be returned; up to 100.
                For optimal performance, the number of returned forum topics is chosen by Telegram Server and can be smaller than the specified limit
                By default, no limit is applied and all topics are returned.

        Returns:
            ``Generator``: A generator yielding :obj:`~pyrogram.types.ForumTopic` objects.
